# crafting-workshop-1

For being fully prepared to this workshop, please install visual code : <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
I recommend to install the following extension:

* a test explorer for running easily test:  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer>
* solution explorer, for managing your solution : <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer>
* live share for coding together : <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare>
* omnisharp to run C# code : <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp>

You will need too :

* a working git client that can authenticate with github. (if you're not familiar with git and ssh, please use : <https://desktop.github.com/>, it should be simple )
* dotnet core SDK : <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download>
* curiosity :)

If all this thing are too complicated, came to the workshop, you're still can came and discover how a TDD peering look like.
Another thing, it will be great that you check with a colleague if live share work correctly.

## Let's start

* Fork this repository
* Respect the TDD discpline : "You are not allowed to write production code that is not justified by a test" and make "Baby step"
* Commit your work after each TDD loop
* After each TDD loop, the coder switch

## A classic kata for beginning with TDD : the String Calculator

* We will build a program that take as an input a string that contains numbers and return the sum of this number.
* Don't lose time with checking invalid inputs.
* Please don't read ahead the step to follow.
* Each step didn't match with a baby step. You can do as many baby step as you want.

[Here the first step](step1.md)
