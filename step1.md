# Step 1

## Create a simple String calculator with a method signature

```csharp
int Add(string numbers)
```

## Hints

* Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
* Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
* Remember to refactor after each passing test

Once it's done, go to [step 2](step2.md)
